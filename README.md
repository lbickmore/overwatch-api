# Unofficial Overwatch API  
Looking for the [Change Log](#change-log)?  
Or maybe the [Style Guide](#style-rules)?  
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/t9jG9N3F/overwatch-api)?  
I can't think of anything else you could want from me, if you're still reading this hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/blueshoesyes) I guess <3

## To Do
 * Convert into REST API or something akin to that.
 * Grab player level and add to a player stats key in the players data object

## Completed Features
 * Command line tool to pull data for any user given their user information and system.  
   Ex: `cli.rb pc BlueShoesYes 1548` will return with a csv of all my stats :D


## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web Scraper that pulls stats from playoverwatch.com
